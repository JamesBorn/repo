# Overview

*  **This project serves to create and demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used study 


*  **A full description of the data is available at The UCI Machine Learning Repository


*  **The source data for this project can be found here http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 


*  **Making Modifications to This Script, download the  data and put them in  the current directory (you have to unzipped this data file after downloading in the cureent directory). In R, set the current directory


  
# Project Summary
* You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

* 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
* 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
* 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
* 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for
